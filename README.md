*Our analysis shows 38% of the 5-Star reviews are "paid"*

## Summary

Our analysis shows that the overall reviews showed approximately 38.7% of reviews were 5-Star and that 38.2% of paid Vine members gave 5-Star reviews.  While there is no data around influence (we could run additional analysis on when the reviews were given to potentially hypothesize that there was influence based on previous reviews), this is extremely close in a star rating system with 5 tiers.

*We determine that the paid program is successful and doesn't bias the reviewers*
